# Computational Physics: class notes

Class notes for the course by Prof. Gerson J. Ferreira, at UFU-MG/Brazil.

## Content of this repository

> Main content: online book [Intro to CompPhys](https://compphysics.readthedocs.io/)

> [PDF slides](PDF_Slides/): with old class notes that are still useful

> PDF book about [Intro to CompPhys in Julia](JuliaBook/FisComp.pdf)

- It's unfinished because Julia was changing the language too much at the time, so we decided to focus com Python, and we started to move the content to the webpage above.

> Short class notes on [high-performance computing](HPC/)

- The plan of this course was to set up a cluster using the lab computers and learn how to develop and run codes in parallel. But we were hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and shifted to online classes focused on C/C++, OpenMP, Lapack/BLAS and single-computer parallelism.

## About the course

Most of the introductory course will be given using **Python** as primary language. But if you already know some other language, or if you want to learn other languages (C, C++, Fortran, Julia, R, ...), please let me know. Advanced courses might use C/C++, Fortran, shell scripting, etc.

The introductory course is guided by projects. Essentially we will learn how to:

- plot figures with high quality
- numerical derivatives and integrals
- solve differential equations
- numerical Fourier transform and spectral analysis
- statistics, Monte Carlo
- machine learning
- molecular dynamics
- ...

To run python on your computer, use [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/).
