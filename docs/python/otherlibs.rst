Other libraries
===============

SciPy
-----

The **Scientific Python** (SciPy) library is similar, but complements numpy. For now, check this `tutorial <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scipy/index.htm>`_

SymPy
-----

The **Symbolic Python** (SymPy) allows for symbolic calculation in python. This means using symbols instead of numbers to do analytical calculations like Mathematica or Maple. The SymPy is great, but not perfect yet. Be careful. For now, check this `tutorial <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sympy/index.htm>`_

Others
------

- **tqdm**: interesting to track the progress and remaining time of a long loop;
- **opencv**: image and video manipulation;
- **plotly**: beautiful and interactive plots in jupyter
