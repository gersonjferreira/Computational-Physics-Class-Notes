Introduction
============

These are the class notes for the course *Computational Physics*, lectured to the students of *Bacharelado em Física*, *Física Médica*, and *Licenciatura em Física* from the *Instituto de Física*, *Universidade Federal de Uberlândia* (**UFU**). Since this is an optional class intended for students with diverse knowledge and interest in Computational Physics and computer languages, I choose to discuss selected topics superficially with practical examples that may interest the students. Advanced topics are proposed as *home projects* to the students accordingly to their interest. 

Initially, I had written a book draft with examples in `Julia <https://julialang.org>`_, but since then this language has changed a lot (improved, actually!). The idea of this new webpage is to move the content of the book here and write examples in many languages (*Julia, Python, and C*). This will be a long process and I'll start with **Python** because its documentation is more accessible to new students. Later I'll add examples in Julia and C.

Topics
------

Since this is an introductory course, we'll focus on simple topics that are useful to solve physics problems. Namely:

#. Introduction to the computer language
#. Plotting beautiful figures
#. Numerical calculus: integrals, derivatives, root finding, ...
#. Linear algebra: system of eqs., eigenvalues, ...
#. Differential equations: initial value problems and boundary value problems
#. Fourier transforms
#. Random numbers and statistics
#. Machine / Deep learning (*soon*)

All these topics will be applied to solve physics problems in exercies along the course.
